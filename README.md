# supermarket_costumers_analysis
Consumer sales analysis based on a binary data table (R and Python)

The idea is to understand the existing relationships between aisles (variables) and customers (rows) of a binary dataset using the binary logistic biplot of Vicente-Villard√≥n (2006),
going through a dimensionality reduction based on random sampling, with its respective sample validation, and subsequent graphic representation using a biplot.
